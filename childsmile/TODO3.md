now we need to:
 - add login with email and 2FA with TOTP for google/non google accounts
  -  click on login with email - entered email will get a TOTP code to his email - so after click we show a new input for TOTP code
  -  entered TOTP code will be verified in the backend and if correct the user will be logged in
 - non exiting users that are going to be a tutor/volunteer - need to change the registration flow to add email and TOTP setup / add google account linking
 - update the frontend to handle email and TOTP login flows
- update the backend to handle email and TOTP login flows
- non exiting users that are going to be a staff - send them an email to login with a link to homepage
