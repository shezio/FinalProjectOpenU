The next screen is **Task Management (5.7.12)**
1. Tasks Automatically Created by the System**
**a. Candidate Interview for Tutoring:**  
- Requires searching and updating candidate records.  
- After a phone interview, the task will mark whether the interview was successful or not.  
**b. Adding a Tutor:**  
- Following a successful interview, a task is created for the Tutoring Coordinator to add the tutor.  
- Adding the tutor automatically removes them from the list of candidates.  
- A new task for matching a tutee to the tutor will then be created.  
**c. Matching a Tutee:**  
- A complex process for matching a tutee with a tutor.  
- Both the Tutoring Coordinator and Family Coordinator can perform the matching after initial filtering.  
- Filtering involves selecting tutors and running a "Perform Filtering" operation based on geographic proximity (city and/or maximum defined distance) and gender.  
- The task completes only after approval from both coordinators to avoid data loss and parallel work.  
- The interface will show tutee details (name, age), and clicking will display full details in an organized manner.  
**d. Adding a Family:**  
- Performed by the Registration Coordinator after filling in preliminary details.  
- This task appears after a volunteer initially adds a family.  
**e. Family Status Check:**  
- Created for the Family Coordinator at the start of each calendar month.  
- The coordinator must contact the family to update details, mark inactive, or add "Healthy" members.  
- Families created within the last 24 hours will generate a status task for the Family Coordinator.  
- Can also be performed by other coordinators.  
**f. Family Update:**  
- A task for the Family Coordinator and Registration Coordinator, created when a family’s details need updating.  
- Triggered by marking relevant options during the completion of the Family Status Check task.  
**g. Family Deletion:**  
- A task for the Family Coordinator to mark a family as inactive and move it to the archive.  
- Triggered by marking options during the Family Status Check task.  
**h. Adding a Healthy Member:**  
- During a family update task, the user can mark a child as "healthy."  
- Saving this update generates a task for the Family Coordinator to add the healthy member.  
- Accessible via the Healthy Member Management screen or directly from the task itself.  
**i. Reviewing a Mature Individual:**  
- Automatically generated when a tutee turns 16.  
- A task is created for the Mature Individuals Coordinator to review and update their details if necessary.  
- Accessible via the Mature Individuals Management screen or directly from the task.  
**j. Tutoring:**  
- A weekly task for the tutor, valid until completion, with a one-week deadline.  
- The tutor marks task completion, triggering a feedback task.  
**k. Tutoring Feedback:**  
- Created immediately after completing a tutoring task, with a 48-hour deadline.  
- Completion of this task generates a task for the Tutoring Coordinator to review the feedback.  
**l. Reviewing Tutor Feedback:**  
- Created for the Tutoring Coordinator upon feedback completion by a tutor.  
- Separate tasks are created for each tutor.  
- Feedback review can also be managed by generating a Tutor Feedback Report.  
- Accessible via the Feedback Management screen or directly from the task.  
**m. General Volunteer Feedback:**  
- After an event or fun day, the Volunteer Coordinator creates feedback tasks for all known participants.  
- Upon feedback submission, a task is generated for the volunteer to review feedback.  
**n. Reviewing General Volunteer Feedback:**  
- Created for the Volunteer Coordinator after volunteers submit feedback.  
- Separate tasks are created for each volunteer.  
- Feedback review can also be managed by generating a General Volunteer Feedback Report.  
- Accessible via the Feedback Management screen or directly from the task.  
**o. Feedback Report Generation:**  
- A monthly task for each coordinator to generate feedback reports for their volunteers (Tutors and General Volunteers).  
- Coordinators can identify recurring issues and analyze feedback completeness rates (e.g., word count in free-text fields).  
- Generating a report can automatically complete multiple individual feedback review tasks.  
- A system admin can restrict this functionality to prevent bulk task completion.  
2. Tasks created manually by staff:
a. Volunteer update – action to be performed by the Volunteer Coordinator - following the registration of a new volunteer or any change in details
a task that can be created by the volunteer himself as a request to update details or by the Volunteer Coordinator to be performed at a later date. 
If it is a volunteer delay, the volunteer will be marked as "inactive," and their account will be suspended until action is taken by the coordinator.
b. Tutor update - action to be performed by the Tutor Coordinator - any change in details - a task that can be created by the tutor himself 
as a request to update details or by the Tutor Coordinator to be performed at a later date. If it is a tutor delay, the tutor will be marked as "inactive," 
and their account will be suspended until action is taken by the coordinator.
c. Mature update - action to be performed by the Mature Individuals Coordinator - any change in details - a task that can be created by the Mature 
Individuals Coordinator to be performed at a later date. If it is a mature individual delay, the mature individual will be marked as "inactive," and their 
account will be suspended until action is taken by the coordinator.
d. Healthy update - action to be performed by the Healthy Coordinator - any change in details - a task that can be created by the Healthy Coordinator 
to be performed at a later date. If it is a healthy individual delay, the healthy individual will be marked as "inactive," and their account will be suspended
 until action is taken by the coordinator.
3. Tasks to be performed without using the task board
a. Family registration - a task for volunteers only - adding a family name and phone number - to be performed without adding to the task board.
b. Volunteer registration - login without a password by linking to the system to create an initial user for registration to the organization - 
users who are not registered will create themselves in the system by performing this task.
performing this task will automatically create an interview task for the candidate for tutoring or update task for the volunteer coordinator.

PERMISSIONS

ok now im gonna need ur help to create permissions
these are the guidelines
Database Permissions: Define roles and permissions in your database.

Backend Logic: Implement logic in your backend to enforce these permissions.

Custom Permission Class: Use Django REST Framework's custom permissions to check if a user has the required permissions before performing any action.

Steps to Implement Frontend Permission Control

Load Permissions on Login:

When a user logs in, fetch their permissions from the backend and store them in the frontend (e.g., in the Redux store or React context).

Control Page Access:

Use the stored permissions to control access to different pages and components in your React application.

Backend Permission Checks:

Still enforce permissions on the backend to ensure security, even if the frontend tries to bypass it.


and my users will be superuser with all access to the system which would be me by default so we will need a user for me by default
and also permissions and roles by this table


5.6. Users and Permissions
The system includes various types of permissions and access levels to prevent unnecessary access to information and avoid loss of data by unauthorized users.
5.6.1. User Roles
System Administrator (ADMIN): Full system access, including user and permission management.
Finance Manager: Access limited to financial management screens only.
Technical Coordinator: Permissions equivalent to ADMIN, excluding financial management.
5 types of Coordinators:
Family Coordinator: Can update family details, including marking for deletion.
Tutor Coordinator: Can update tutor details, including marking for deletion.
Volunteer Coordinator: Can update volunteer details, including marking for deletion.
Mature Individuals Coordinator: Can update mature individual details, including marking for deletion.
Healthy Coordinator: Can update healthy individual details, including marking for deletion.
Volunteer: Limited to creating a family entry only.
5.6.2. Permissions Matrix
Permission Type	Roles with Access
Create, update, and delete users; assign permissions	System Administrator
Create and update volunteer details	System Administrator, Coordinators (Volunteers/Families/Tutors/Mature Individuals)
Create, update, and delete family records	System Administrator, Technical Coordinator
Update family details and mark for deletion	System Administrator, Technical Coordinator, Coordinators (Volunteers/Families/Tutors/Mature Individuals)
Create, update, and delete financial activities	System Administrator
View volunteer details	System Administrator, Technical Coordinator, Coordinators (Volunteers/Families/Tutors/Mature Individuals)
View family details	System Administrator, Technical Coordinator, Coordinators (Volunteers/Families/Tutors/Mature Individuals)
we will probably need to insert rows into staff and other tables to have that work and maybe also update some models and other files
### Current Setup Review
1. **Models**: You've organized your models into different files based on context, which is great for maintainability.
3. **Views**: You've set up viewsets for each model to handle CRUD operations.
4. **URLs**: You've registered your viewsets with a router and included them in your URL configuration.
5. **Admin**: You've registered your models with the Django admin site for easy management.

### Next Steps
Since you're focusing on the backend for now and plan to build the frontend later, here are the steps to ensure your backend is fully prepared:

1. **Testing Your API**:
   - Use tools like Postman or cURL to test your API endpoints. This will help you ensure that your CRUD operations work as expected.
   - Example: Test adding a new family by sending a POST request to `/api/families/`.

2. **Authentication and Permissions**:
   - Implement authentication (e.g., JWT, OAuth) to secure your API endpoints.
   - Define permissions to control access based on user roles.

3. **Documentation**:
   - Use tools like Swagger or DRF's built-in API documentation to document your API endpoints. This will be helpful when you start building the frontend.
   - Example: Add `drf_yasg` to your project for Swagger documentation.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensure your API handles errors gracefully and returns meaningful error messages.

5. **Database Migrations**:
   - Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to apply your database schema changes.

### Example: Adding a Family (Backend Only)
Here's a detailed example of how to add a family using your current setup:

#### 1. **Test Adding a Family with Postman**:
   - URL: `http://localhost:8000/api/families/`
   - Method: POST
   - Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
   - Body:
     ```json
     {
       "family_name": "Smith",
       "address": "123 Main St",
       "city": "Anytown",
       "phone_number": "1234567890",
       "email": "smith@example.com",
       "is_active": true
     }
     ```

#### 2. **Check the Response**:
   - Ensure the response status is 201 Created.
   - Verify the response body contains the newly created family.

### Summary
- **Backend**: Your current setup is correct. Focus on testing, authentication, permissions, documentation, and error handling.
- **Frontend**: When you're ready to build the frontend, you'll use React to make API requests to your Django backend.

By following these steps, you'll ensure your backend is robust and ready for when you start building the frontend. Let me know if you need further assistance or have any questions! 😊
